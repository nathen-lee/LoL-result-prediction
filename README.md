# Introduction
Our project will build a classification model predicting the results, i.e, wins and losses, of  League of Legends professional teams in 2022 . Our model takes into consideration the various features provided as columns in the dataset. The dataset being used is a cleaned version of the data provided by https://oracleselixir.com/tools/downloads with rows and columns corresponding to our research focus. This dataset has 4948 total rows and 12 total columns. Each row in our dataset corresponds to a teamâ€™s statistics in a certain game.
The columns correspond to those statistics:
- <mark>gametype</mark> states whether the game was played on a regional stage or international stage. 
- <mark>league</mark> corresponds to the league/tournament the game was from.
- <mark>result</mark> declares whether or not a team won(1) or a team lost(0).
- <mark>kills</mark> corresponds to the total sum of the kills of each player of the team. 
- <mark>dragons</mark> corresponds to the total number of dragons the team killed over the course of the game.
- <mark>elders</mark> corresponds to the total number of elder dragons the team killed over the course of the game.
- <mark>heralds</mark> corresponds to the total number of rift heralds the team killed over the course of the game.
- <mark>barons</mark> corresponds to the total number of baron nashors the team killed over the course of the game.
- <mark>towers</mark> corresponds to the total number of towers the team destroyed over the course of the game.
